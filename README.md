Developed a comprehensive system to analyze health screening data of 1400 students, identifying correlations and abnormalities through advanced data analytics and mining techniques. The project includes generating detailed summary reports, graphical representations, and parameter-specific insights, accessible via a user-friendly web interface. This system supports real-time data input, interactive querying, and visualization to facilitate informed decision-making in student health management.
